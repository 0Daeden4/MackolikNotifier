# Goals

The idea was to create a script to display match scores by "scraping" mackolik and use a notification service, which allows the customization of 
notifications.

## TODO

The project is still on its early stages and there are a lot of things to be done such as:

  -Make update interval customizeable and make team selection easier
  -Import update interval and selected teams
  -Match <Selected Teams> with the current information and extract their ids
